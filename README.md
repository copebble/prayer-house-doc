# prayer house doc

This repository documents the process of developing the `Prayer House` application and the lessons learned along the way.

It contains records of the challenges I encountered, the various approaches I considered to solve them, and the related topics I studied. The notes are written in an unstructured manner, reflecting my thought process as I explored and experimented with different ideas.
